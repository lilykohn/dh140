# DH140 Assignment 1
## Personal Profile
My name is Lily Kohn. I am a third year PhD student in Sociocultual Anthropology. My research focuses on public mourning in online spaces; specifically I am working on a project that looks at a virtual memorial day event hosted annually by a group of Israeli and Palestinian organizers. Prior to coming to UCLA, I worked as a social impact strategist for a number of nonprofit organizations and media companies that specialized in distrubting social justice documentaries. I received my BA from NYU, and I am originally from Athens, GA! 

## Course Description
*Taken from the [Course Website](https://bruinlearn.ucla.edu/courses/111826/assignments/syllabus).*
Coding is a skill. Coding is an art. Coding is a tool for creating other forms of expression, web sites, video games, music, and graphic visualizations of the flow of information and ideas. Coding has produced products that unify people, separate people, reinforce love, reinforce prejudice, entertain, bore, destroy, propagandize, and calm. Coding has had an undeniable impact on the modern world. This course will introduce you to coding through the language of Python.

On the one hand, the course will develop your fluency in Python and general coding skills. We will learn how to speak grammatically correct Python to the computer, we will learn about Python in the context of other languages, we will learn how to use libraries of Python code, and we will learn how to use Python to tell stories of our own. On the other hand, the course will expose you to ways that Python can be used in the humanities. During our hands-on experiences gaining Python fluency, weâ€™ll look at examples that include (but are not limited to) identifying patterns in literature, recommending new music to your friends, mapping urban inequities, and analyzing social networks.

## Project Ideas
1. Text analysis of transcript from Israel-Palestinian Joint Memorial Day Ceremony (current research subject)
2. Mapping project of Palestinian sites of memory (if dataset is available)
3. Analysis of demographic information of those buried on Hart Island in NYC
4. Text analysis of something within anthropological canon

## Course Objectives
I hope to gain a basic, working knowledge of Python in this course, as well as consider more fully the ways in which I might incorporate digitality into my research methodology and topics. I am very interested in thinking through ways to make anthropological scholarship more accessible to a public audience, and the courses I have taken in the Digital Humanites thus far have helped me consider new ways to present data. Also genuinely excited to learn some hard skills!
